Hello ðŸ‘‹ 

Trying to make time to learn new things;

-  Iâ€™m currently interested in bettering my coding skills through open source contributions
-  I have worked with HTML, CSS, JS, REACT, SVELTE and hope to increase my understanding and discover new stuff

/* NEW GOAL
    Explore PYTHON and more backend

Short term goals:
- [] increase practical use of Svelte and React
- [] create a pull request for an open source project
- [] actively use Github on most days and get some green squares building up on my profile
- [] review data science with Python
