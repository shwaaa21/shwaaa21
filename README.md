Hello ðŸ‘‹ 

Trying to make time to learn new things;

-  Iâ€™m currently interested in bettering my coding skills through open source contributions
-  I have worked with HTML, CSS, JS, REACT, PYTHON and hope to increase my understanding in these and discover new stuff

/* NEW GOAL
    Learning SVELTEKIT as it seems cool and simple */

Short term goals:
- [] master Svelte 
- [] create a pull request for a project
- [] actively use Github on most days and get some green squares building up on my profile
